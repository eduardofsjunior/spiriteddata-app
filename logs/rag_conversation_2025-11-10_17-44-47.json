Please let me go\"\n   - **Minute 81**:\n     - \"You see, somebody I really care about got hurt very badly\"\n     - \"It's staying in here that'll make you sick!\"\n   - **Minute 82**:\n     - \"You're a little butterball, aren't you?\"\n     - \"If you don't play with me, I'll cry...\"\n\nBased on this dialogue pattern, I imagine scenes of intense emotional confrontation and personal revelations. The positive peaks may reflect moments of determination and self-realization, while the negative peaks could signify conflicts and emotional distress.\n\nThese insights were enabled by the Emotion Archive tool, which allowed me to analyze minute-by-minute sentiment in the subtitles of \"Spirited Away.\""
