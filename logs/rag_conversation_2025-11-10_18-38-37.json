You know not to set foot on this island.\" while FR uses \"C'est à cause de lui qu'on se terre ici dans ces foutues peaux d'animal.\" These variations may reflect different emotional nuances in the translations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe emotional arcs in \"Princess Mononoke\" exhibit some divergence between the English and French versions, with differences in emotional peaks and dialogue choices.
